### Project Structure

* All templates are located inside `src/views` and most of them are self-contained.
* There's only one single layout defined (Default) inside `src/layouts`, however the current structure provides an easy way of extending the UI kit.
* The `src/components` directory hosts all template-specific subcomponents in their own subdirectory.
* Almost all components have their styles isolated in SFC, however, some global styles are also placed inside `src/assets/scss` next to daltix Dashboard Lite's base styles.
* The `src/utils` directory contains generic Chart.js utilities.
